# Setup

Three pieces: the **commands** (slash commands for Claude Code), two **MCP servers** (live data: Google Search Console + DataForSEO), and the **knowledge base** (the methodology the commands cite).

## 1. Install the commands

Copy everything in `commands/` to your Claude Code commands folder:

```bash
# global (all projects)
cp commands/*.md ~/.claude/commands/

# or per-project
cp commands/*.md your-project/.claude/commands/
```

That's it — they show up as `/seo-analyze`, `/seo-quick-wins`, etc.

## 2. Google Search Console MCP (free, required)

The commands call tools named `mcp__gsc__*`, so the server **must be registered under the name `gsc`**.

This setup uses [`suganthan-gsc-mcp`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/suganthan-gsc-mcp), which ships SEO-specific tools beyond raw search analytics (`quick_wins`, `cannibalization_check`, `inspect_url`, `content_gaps`, …).

```jsonc
// .mcp.json (project) or claude_desktop_config.json (global), under "mcpServers":
"gsc": {
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "suganthan-gsc-mcp"],
  "env": {
    "GSC_AUTH_MODE": "oauth",
    "GSC_OAUTH_SECRETS_FILE": "/path/to/your-oauth-client-secret.json",
    "GSC_SITE_URL": "sc-domain:yourdomain.com",
    "GSC_SITE_URLS": "sc-domain:yourdomain.com,sc-domain:yourotherdomain.com"
  }
}
```

> On Windows, wrap the command as `"command": "cmd", "args": ["/c", "npx", "-y", "suganthan-gsc-mcp"]`.

Getting the OAuth secrets file (one-time, ~5 minutes):
1. [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) → create/select a project
2. Enable the **Search Console API**
3. Credentials → Create **OAuth client ID** (Desktop app) → download the JSON
4. Point `GSC_OAUTH_SECRETS_FILE` at it; first run opens a browser to authorize

`GSC_SITE_URL` is the default property the commands query; `GSC_SITE_URLS` lets you switch between several properties. Domain properties use the `sc-domain:` prefix.

**Heads-up on date ranges:** the tools take a `days` parameter (28/90/180). Explicit start/end dates are ignored — widen via `days`.

## 3. DataForSEO MCP (paid, pay-per-call, required for difficulty/SERP/volume)

The commands call tools named `mcp__dataforseo__*`, so the server **must be registered under the name `dataforseo`**.

```jsonc
"dataforseo": {
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["dataforseo-mcp-server"],
  "env": {
    "DATAFORSEO_USERNAME": "your-account-email",
    "DATAFORSEO_PASSWORD": "your-api-password"
  }
}
```

Sign up at [dataforseo.com](https://dataforseo.com/) — it's prepaid credit, **no subscription needed**. The commands only use:
- **DataForSEO Labs** (keyword difficulty, related keywords, keyword ideas, search intent, domain rank)
- **SERP API** (live Google results for validation)

Real-world cost per command run: **$0 – $0.18** (each command lists its cost at the bottom; GSC calls are always free). You do **NOT** need the Backlinks API subscription (~$100+/mo) — nothing here uses it.

## 4. The knowledge base

The commands cite the methodology by section number ("Section 17", "Section 26.3") — all of it lives in [`knowledge-base/seo-knowledge-base.md`](../knowledge-base/seo-knowledge-base.md).

Two ways to use it:
- **Just run the commands.** The relevant rules are baked into each command's instructions; the knowledge base is the source they were distilled from.
- **Give Claude the full base.** Copy `seo-knowledge-base.md` into your project (e.g. `docs/`) and add one line to your `CLAUDE.md`: `SEO methodology: docs/seo-knowledge-base.md`. Now Claude can look up the reasoning behind any rule mid-task — and you can ask it things like "what does the base say about republishing?"

## 5. Sanity check

Start Claude Code and run:

```
/seo-quick-wins yourdomain.com
```

If you get a table of Pos-4-15 keywords (or an honest "0 quick wins"), everything is wired up.
