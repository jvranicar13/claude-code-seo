You are vetting a link opportunity: **$ARGUMENTS**

This runs on the cheap DataForSEO **Labs** endpoints + reading the actual site — it does NOT need the (expensive, subscription-only) Backlinks API. The methodology is Section 25 of the knowledge base, operationalized:

- A link only transfers authority if the linking **PAGE** itself ranks and earns clicks. Even 1 click/week counts; a DR-70 page with zero traffic transfers nothing.
- DR/DA is a homepage assumption — never evaluate the domain, always the page.
- Link-farm neighborhoods (100+ outbound links across random niches) are worthless at best, a footprint at worst.

## Execute in order

### Step 1: Resolve the real domain
WebFetch the given URL/domain. Follow redirects (vanity domains often 301 elsewhere — vet the destination, not the shell). Note who runs it if discoverable (about/contact page).

### Step 2: Does the DOMAIN have organic life at all?
Call `mcp__dataforseo__dataforseo_labs_google_domain_rank_overview` (target = resolved domain).
- Organic keyword count, position distribution, ETV (estimated traffic value).
- **ETV under ~100/mo or zero top-10 rankings → the whole domain is barely alive; everything below it inherits that.**

### Step 3: What does it actually rank FOR?
Call `mcp__dataforseo__dataforseo_labs_google_ranked_keywords` (target = domain, limit 20, ordered by search volume desc).
- Are the top keywords in or adjacent to YOUR niche — or random one-offs from guest posts (a dev-tools blog ranking mainly for "maui car rentals" is a guest-post farm, not a topical site)?
- Niche fit test: would a user searching their top keywords plausibly also search yours? (Section 1, Topical Bridges)

### Step 4: The page that would carry your link
This is the decisive check.
- If a specific page/section was offered, WebFetch it. If it exists already: call `ranked_keywords` on that exact URL — does THE PAGE rank or get traffic?
- If the offered placement is a NEW page (fresh guest post, "partners" page): it starts with zero rank, zero traffic → per Section 25 its value today is zero. It can become valuable later only if that page itself starts ranking.
- **Red flags:** dedicated link sections ("partners", "friends", "sponsors", "wingmen"-style), 50-100+ outbound links across unrelated niches (roofing next to crypto next to gyms), every post written for/about a different external business.

### Step 5: Editorial smell test
WebFetch 1-2 of their regular articles. Real editorial content for readers, or content that exists to carry links? Count irrelevant dofollow outbounds per article — more than a couple is a seller/exchange pattern.

### Step 6: Verdict + reply strategy

Output exactly one of:

- **ACCEPT** — the specific linking page ranks/has traffic, niche fits, outbound profile clean. Proceed: in-content placement, descriptive partial-match anchor (not exact-money), mid-paragraph. Reciprocate only from a mid-tier article of yours WITH traffic (protect your top pages), and only AFTER their link is live and verified. Prefer a 3-way (A→B→C) if they run multiple sites.
- **COUNTER** — domain is real but the offered placement is worthless (new guest page, link section). Counter with: contextual in-content link inside an article of theirs that ALREADY ranks, on a topic adjacent to yours. Provide the exact counter-message text.
- **DECLINE** — no traffic, no fit, or link-farm pattern. Decline politely, leave the door open ("if you ever have an in-content spot in a ranking article about <your niche>, happy to revisit"). Provide the decline text.

Always include: the 2-3 data points that decided it (ETV, top keywords, the linking page's own rank/traffic) so the human can sanity-check the call.

## Operating rules
- **Never reveal your target URLs first** — share your domain and samples, but lock the exact pairing only after their side is verified.
- **Your reciprocal link goes live only after vetting passes AND their link is placed.** Sequence is the protection.
- Be honest in the verdict: a polite decliner today can be a great partner in 6 months when their pages rank.

## Cost
~$0.02–0.05 per vet (2-3 Labs calls; WebFetch is free). No Backlinks API subscription needed.
